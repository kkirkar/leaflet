## TASK
We create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet 
and host our webpage on either GitHub Pages.

The webpage contains the date I created the document, and it contains the map I created with Leaflet.

### CODE 

```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers(lat=51.5150031, lng=-0.2093415,
             popup="XL Recordings")
my_map
```
